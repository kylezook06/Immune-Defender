## Concept: “Immune Defender”

- You control a **big white blood cell** at the bottom of the screen.
- **Pathogens** (little virus/bacteria sprites) drift in rows from the top, Galaga-style.
- You fire **phagocytosis bursts** (little white shots) upward.
- When a burst hits a pathogen, you “engulf” it and it pops in a little particle poof.
- If pathogens reach the bottom or collide with you, you lose lives.
- As a nod to antibodies, occasionally a **special pathogen** drops a power-up that gives you rapid fire for a short time.

All drawn with simple shapes and colors to feel like an 80s arcade game.

### New refinements

- **Wave progression:** Survive up to six increasingly dense and faster enemy waves.
- **Two power-ups:** Antibody Boost (rapid fire) and a membrane **shield** that saves you from one collision or leak.
- **HUD polish:** Wave counter plus short timers showing how long each power-up remains.
- **Visual clarity:** Shield aura around the player and distinct icon shapes for the two power-ups.

### How to play

1. Paste `sketch.js` into the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and press the **Play** button.
2. Use `←` / `→` to move and **Space** to shoot.
3. Clear all six waves to neutralize the infection. Collect power-ups as they drift down to gain rapid fire or a protective bubble.
