## Concept: “Immune Defender”

-   You control a **big white blood cell** at the bottom of the screen.
    
-   **Pathogens** (little virus/bacteria sprites) drift in rows from the top, Galaga-style.
    
-   You fire **phagocytosis bursts** (little white shots) upward.
    
-   When a burst hits a pathogen, you “engulf” it and it pops in a little particle poof.
    
-   If pathogens reach the bottom or collide with you, you lose lives.
    
-   As a nod to antibodies, occasionally a **special pathogen** drops a power-up that gives you rapid fire for a short time.
    

All drawn with simple shapes and colors to feel like an 80s arcade game.
